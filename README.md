# DEButilities
Utility functions for Dynamic Energy Budget models.

THis is a collection of functions adapted from [DEBtool_M](https://github.com/add-my-pet/DEBtool_M) and [DEBtool_R](https://github.com/add-my-pet/DEBtool_R), to facilitate DEB parameter estimation with [deBInfer](https://github.com/pboesu/debinfer).
